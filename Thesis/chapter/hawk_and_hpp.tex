\chapter{Hawk and HPP}
\section{Overview}
In this chapter, the Hawk digital signature scheme and the \textit{Learning a Parallelepiped} cryptanalytic attack will be presented.
This will lay the foundation for chapter 4, which will employ the \textit{Learning a Parallelepiped} attack against Hawk

In section 3.2, an introduction on how Hawk works on a high level will be given. The algorithms for key generation, signature 
generation and verification and their most important subroutines will be provided with enough detail in order to analyze them properly.
Section 3.3 will discuss some considerations for implementing the scheme.
The \textit{Learning a Parallelepiped} attack is described in section 3.4.
