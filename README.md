# Master-Project-Eirik-Skjerve
Master project for Eirik Skjerve, Secure and Reliable communication, Department of Informatics, University of Bergen


This project will revolve around implementation and cryptanalysis of some of the digital signature schemes submitted in the NIST-competition for a new digital signature standard. 
These submitted signature schemes are supposed to be cryptographically secure in a post-quantum world, where the signature schemes used today could be broken.

Implementation of the algorithms for some of these signature schemes will be a central part of the project. This will be important to gain insight into the schemes, 
in addition to having a "sandbox environment" for cryptanalysis.

The entire project will consist of:
1) Research of the signature schemes, the needed mathematics and relevant cryptanalytic attacks 
2) Implementation of a selection of the signature shcemes in a programming language
3) Cryptanalysis of the implemented schemes
