Master project for Eirik Skjerve, Secure and Reliable communication, Department of Informatics, University of Bergen

### Brief description
This project will revolve around implementation and analysis of a selection of the digital signature schemes submitted in the NIST-competition for a new digital signature standard.
We are currently interested in [HAWK](https://hawk-sign.info/), which is based on the Lattice Isomorphism Problem, a problem believed to be hard to solve even for quantum computers. 

### KeyGenExperiments
The KeyGenExperiments/hawk_py folder is the HAWK algorithms [implemented in Python](https://github.com/hawk-sign/hawk-py) by the Hawk team, with some modifications, permitted by their licence.
