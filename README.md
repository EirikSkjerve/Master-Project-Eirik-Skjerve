### Brief description
This project will revolve around implementation and analysis of a selection of the digital signature schemes submitted in the NIST-competition for a new digital signature standard.
We are currently interested in [HAWK](https://hawk-sign.info/), which is based on the Lattice Isomorphism Problem, a problem believed to be hard to solve even for quantum computers.
