1) HPP should return the direction(s) of columns of B^-1
But is this enough to uniquely define the secret?

2) Is Q = B*B equivalent to BtB? Also, we need B^-1 t B in that case

3) Need to show what the gradient of the fourth moment is

4) Need somehow show that +/- a column of B^-1 is local or 
global maxima/minima (hopefully)

5) Is it such that all samples after hypercube transformation is 
inside the [-1, 1] hypercube as rationals? I don't think so...

6) Should the vector w in gradient descent be / not be on the 
unit circle based on the results of above?<3
