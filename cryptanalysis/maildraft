Draft for mail to Igor

Hi again,
I have completed a proof and justification for why HPP will not work against normally distributed samples.
However, I have been reading some more on the discrete Gaussian distribution, 
and I have realized that it might not be that straightforward to prove the same claim for this distribution, 
and that my initial ideas/computations were perhaps wrong. 
In the attached file is a some justification for the continuous normal distribution, and a preliminary sketch of a proof in the discrete case, 
but I am unsure of how to proceed. So maybe we can talk about these things in our meeting next week?

Best regards,
Eirik Skjerve
